# About

hi, i'm tyson!

i'm a graduate from the university of washington with a bs in mechEng.  

i'm interested in utlizing advanced medical imaging modalities to generate large datasets to explore and characterize the biomechanical properties of the brain, aiming to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of its structural and functional dynamics! (woo a mouthful there ðŸ˜…)
